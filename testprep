IPv6 uses Egress only Internet Gateway for outbound requests form a private subnet. For IPv4 outbound internet traffic from a private subnet, you can use a NAT instance or NAT Gateway.

NAT gateway is deployed inside a subnet and it can scale only inside that subnet. For fault tolerance, it is recommended that you deploy one NAT gateway per availability zone.

Using the Session Manager (part of the system manager service), authorized employees can log in to their EC2 instances using IAM credentials. Session manager does not use SSH or RDP ports.

Interface endpoint per availability zone and need to pick a subnet in each AZ and add an interface endpoint to that subnet.

AWS availability zone ID > same id across accounts> corss accounts integration.

Transit Gateway > link VPCs > TGW routetable to route >

Site to Site VPN > traffic routed over the internet on an encrpted tunner > Client VPN provice remote connectivity to AWS from any locations > for low traffic and cost

Direct connect > consistent network performance at high throughput

Two different direct connect locations between on prem and aws connectivity > high availability

AMI > foreign code > due diligence > thirdparty > price set by seller

Unlimited mode in burstable types

SSD instance storage > high random I/O requirement
HDD for sequecncial I/O

Private IPv4 based comminction inside an availability zone is free. Intra-region pricing applies for any traffic between Availability zones.

For license that are tied to hardware socket and cores, you can use either dedicated hosts or bare metal instances.

System status check would idenity aws infra related issues. Instance status check would also fail if a system status check fails. so either on can be used.
