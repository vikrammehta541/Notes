A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration + Multipart Uploads

📌 Tags: Global Upload, High-Speed, Low Ops, Fastest Path, S3TA

📝 Notes:

S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) uses Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations to accelerate data uploads over long distances.

Multipart upload speeds up large file transfers and improves resiliency.

Ideal for direct uploads from remote global sites with good internet.

No infrastructure to manage, very low operational complexity.

🎯 Best Fit: Fast, global uploads to a single S3 bucket, with minimal setup and max speed.

Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“For Fast Global Uploads, Accelerate S3!”
(S3 Transfer Acceleration is your go-to for global ingestion over the internet)

C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3

📌 Tags: Serverless, SQL on S3, Low Ops, JSON, On-Demand

📝 Notes:

Athena lets you run SQL queries directly on data stored in S3 — including JSON files.

Serverless – no infrastructure to manage.

Perfect for ad-hoc, on-demand querying.

Minimal setup: just define a table schema over your S3 data (you can use AWS Glue for cataloging optionally).

🎯 Best Fit: You already have data in S3, and you need simple queries with minimal changes or overhead.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

"Athena = Ad-hoc Analytics on S3."

A. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key to the S3 bucket policy

📌 Tags: S3 Access Control, Organizations, Low Ops, Secure, Global Restriction

📝 Notes:

aws:PrincipalOrgID is a global condition key that restricts access only to principals (users, roles) in accounts under a specific AWS Organization ID.

This approach automatically includes all accounts in the organization, including newly added ones.

No need to manage individual users, tags, or policies per account.

Very low operational overhead — one policy in S3.

🎯 Best for: Organization-wide access control to a shared S3 bucket.

Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

"Org access? Use OrgID."
(Use PrincipalOrgID to give access to all accounts in the org—simple and scalable.)

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket

🔹 Topic: Private S3 Access
📌 Tags: Private Access, VPC Endpoint, No Internet, S3, Secure, Low Cost

📝 Notes:

A Gateway VPC Endpoint allows private connectivity between EC2 in a VPC and Amazon S3 over the AWS network.

Eliminates need for Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway.

Ensures secure, high-speed, and zero-cost S3 access within AWS.

Ideal when the EC2 instance is in a private subnet and must access S3 securely and privately.

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket

🔹 Topic: Private S3 Access
📌 Tags: Private Access, VPC Endpoint, No Internet, S3, Secure, Low Cost

📝 Notes:

A Gateway VPC Endpoint enables private network connectivity from your EC2 instance to Amazon S3 without requiring internet access.

No need for Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, or public IPs.

Traffic stays on the AWS internal network, improving security and performance.

Zero data transfer cost to S3, and no infrastructure to manage.

The most efficient and secure way to allow EC2 in a VPC to access S3 privately.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Private S3? Use the Gateway VPC Endpoint — no internet needed.”

C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS

🔹 Topic: Shared Storage for Scalability
📌 Tags: Scalability, High Availability, EFS, Shared Storage, Multi-AZ Access

📝 Notes:

EBS volumes are attached to a single EC2 instance only, and cannot be shared across instances or Availability Zones.

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) is a shared file system accessible from multiple EC2 instances across AZs.

Migrating user-uploaded files to EFS ensures all EC2 instances see the same files, resolving the inconsistency users experienced.

Serverless, scalable, and durable — perfect for web applications needing shared storage.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Multi-AZ files? Share with EFS — not EBS.”

B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.

🔹 Topic: Bulk Data Migration
📌 Tags: Snowball Edge, Large Data Transfer, Low Bandwidth, Offline Migration, S3 Import

📝 Notes:

The total data size is 70 TB, and minimizing network bandwidth usage is critical.

AWS Snowball Edge is designed for petabyte-scale offline data transfer to AWS.

No dependency on your existing internet bandwidth — data is physically shipped.

After loading the data, AWS automatically imports it into S3 when the device is returned.

Fastest and most bandwidth-efficient solution for this use case.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Big data, small pipe? Send a Snowball, skip the hype.”

D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

🔹 Topic: Scalable Message Fan-Out
📌 Tags: Scalable, Event-Driven, SNS, SQS, Fan-Out, Decoupling, Burst Handling

📝 Notes:

This uses the SNS + SQS fan-out pattern, ideal for decoupling producers from multiple consumers.

SNS publishes messages to multiple SQS queues, each one read independently by a consumer or microservice.

Highly scalable, can handle sudden traffic spikes (like 100,000 msgs/sec).

Consumers are asynchronous, independent, and can scale separately.

Built-in retry, durability, and at-least-once delivery.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Many consumers? Fan it out — SNS to SQS is what it's about.”

B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.

🔹 Topic: Resilient Job Processing
📌 Tags: SQS, Decoupling, Scalability, Auto Scaling, Event-Driven, Resilient Architecture

📝 Notes:

This architecture decouples job production from job processing using SQS.

Compute nodes in an Auto Scaling group can scale dynamically based on queue depth, ensuring scalability for variable workloads.

SQS is fault-tolerant and durable, which increases resiliency.

Auto Scaling based on queue size ensures the compute fleet matches demand in near real time.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Queue the jobs, scale the nodes — SQS + Auto Scaling handles the loads.”

B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

🔹 Topic: Hybrid File Storage with Lifecycle Management
📌 Tags: SMB, S3 File Gateway, Lifecycle, Low-Latency, Archive, Hybrid Storage, Cost Optimization

📝 Notes:

Amazon S3 File Gateway provides an SMB-compatible file interface that integrates with the existing on-premises file server.

Recently accessed files are cached locally for low-latency access.

Older files are automatically offloaded to S3, extending storage capacity.

An S3 Lifecycle policy can move infrequently accessed files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive, optimizing cost.

Provides automatic lifecycle management, no user disruption, and virtually unlimited backend storage.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Hot files local, cold files to the cloud — File Gateway with Lifecycle makes IT proud.”

B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

🔹 Topic: Ordered Message Processing
📌 Tags: SQS FIFO, Order Preservation, API Gateway, Lambda, Asynchronous, Event-Driven

📝 Notes:

SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are specifically designed to preserve the exact order of message delivery.

Using API Gateway → SQS FIFO → Lambda ensures that orders are processed in the order they are received.

API Gateway receives the HTTP request, sends it to the FIFO queue.

FIFO queues support deduplication, grouping, and ordered processing, which are essential for order-sensitive workflows.

Lambda can poll and process messages sequentially based on message group ID.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“Orders in order? Go FIFO — First In, First Out, First-Class flow.”

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.

🔹 Topic: Database Credential Management
📌 Tags: Secrets Manager, Auto Rotation, Aurora, Secure Storage, Low Ops

📝 Notes:

AWS Secrets Manager securely stores database credentials and provides automatic rotation without application downtime.

Applications can retrieve credentials using the Secrets Manager API/SDK instead of relying on locally stored files.

Tightly integrates with Aurora, making it ideal for minimizing operational overhead.

Provides auditing, encryption (via KMS), and versioning for secret management.

Removes the need for manual updates when credentials change.

💡 Easy Memory Trick (Mnemonic):

“For secrets that rotate, let Secrets Manager automate.”
