A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration + Multipart Uploads

📌 Tags: Global Upload, High-Speed, Low Ops, Fastest Path, S3TA

📝 Notes:

S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) uses Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations to accelerate data uploads over long distances.

Multipart upload speeds up large file transfers and improves resiliency.

Ideal for direct uploads from remote global sites with good internet.

No infrastructure to manage, very low operational complexity.

🎯 Best Fit: Fast, global uploads to a single S3 bucket, with minimal setup and max speed.
